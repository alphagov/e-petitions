      You’re not done yet!

      {{ site.threshold_for_moderation | number_to_word | titleize }} people need to sign your petition for us to check it.

      Send your potential supporters the information at the bottom of this email.

      Once you’ve gained {{ site.threshold_for_moderation | number_to_word }} signatures, we’ll check your petition to make sure it meets the [petition standards]({{ site.standards_url }}). If it does, we’ll publish it. If it doesn’t, we’ll let you know why.

      This can take up to 10 working days. During holiday periods, this may take longer. Thank you for your patience.

      Up to {{ site.maximum_number_of_sponsors }} people can sign your petition while we are checking it. Please wait until it’s been checked and published before sharing it more widely.

      Dear {{ signature.name }},

      You recently started the {{ "petition" | pluralize: count }}:

      {% for petition in petitions %}
      * [{{ petition.action %> }}]({{ petition.url }})
      {% endfor %}

      {% if remaining > 0 %}
      Plus another {{ remaining }} {{ "petition" | pluralize: remaining }}
      {% endif %}

      Because of the General Election, the closing date for your {{ "petition" | pluralize: count }} has changed. All petitions now have to close at {{ closing_time }} on {{ closing_date }}. This is because Parliament will be dissolved, which means all parliamentary business – including petitions – must stop. This means the petitions site will be closed and people will not be able to start or sign petitions.

      We’re sorry we weren’t able to give you more notice that this would happen.

      Your {{ "petition" | pluralize: count }} will be available for people to read on the site even though it will be closed for signatures. Your {{ "petition" | pluralize: count }} can’t be reopened after the election. You are very welcome to start your {{ "petition" | pluralize: count }} again when the site reopens after the election, but we can’t transfer signatures to your new {{ "petition" | pluralize: count }}.

      The Government can’t respond to petitions during the election period. This means if {%if count > 1 %}any of your petitions{% else %}your petition{% endif %} has over {{ site.threshold_for_response }} signatures, {%if count > 1 %}they{% else %}it{% endif %} can’t receive a response from the current Government after {{ last_response_date }}. After the election, the new Government will have to decide whether to respond to petitions from before the election.

      The current Petitions Committee, the group of MPs who decide whether petitions are debated, won’t exist after {{ closing_date }}. This means that if {%if count > 1 %}any of your petitions{% else %}your petition{% endif %} has over {{ site.threshold_for_debate }} signatures, {%if count > 1 %}they{% else %}it{% endif %} can’t be scheduled for debate during this Parliament. After the election, a new Petitions Committee will be responsible for deciding which petitions are debated.

      The petitions site will reopen when a new Petitions Committee is appointed, but at the moment we don’t know exactly when. You can follow us on X [@HoCPetitions](https://x.com/HoCPetitions) for updates, or check back on the petitions site for news.

    subject: We’re closing petitions early
    content: |
      Dear {{ signature.name }},

      You recently signed the {{ "petition" | pluralize: count }}:

      {% for petition in petitions %}
      * [{{ petition.action %> }}]({{ petition.url }})
      {% endfor %}

      {% if remaining > 0 %}
      Plus another {{ remaining }} {{ "petition" | pluralize: remaining }}
      {% endif %}

      Because of the General Election, the closing date for the {{ "petition" | pluralize: count }} you signed has changed. All petitions now have to close at {{ closing_time }} on {{ closing_date }}. This is because Parliament will be dissolved, which means all parliamentary business – including petitions – must stop. This means the petitions site will be closed and people will not be able to start or sign petitions.

      We’re sorry we weren’t able to give you more notice that this would happen.

      you signed has changed {{ "petition" | pluralize: count }} will be available for people to read on the site even though it will be closed for signatures. {% if count > 1 %}These petitions{% else %}This petition{% endif%} won’t be reopened after the election.

      The Government can’t respond to petitions during the election period. This means if {%if count > 1 %}any of the petitions{% else %}the petition{% endif %} has over {{ site.threshold_for_response }} signatures, {%if count > 1 %}they{% else %}it{% endif %} can’t receive a response from the current Government after {{ last_response_date }}. After the election, the new Government will have to decide whether to respond to petitions from before the election.

      The current Petitions Committee, the group of MPs who decide whether petitions are debated, won’t exist after {{ closing_date }}. This means that if {%if count > 1 %}any of the petitions{% else %}the petition{% endif %} has over {{ site.threshold_for_debate }} signatures, {%if count > 1 %}they{% else %}it{% endif %} can’t be scheduled for debate during this Parliament. After the election, a new Petitions Committee will be responsible for deciding which petitions are debated.

      The petitions site will reopen when a new Petitions Committee is appointed, but at the moment we don’t know exactly when. You can follow us on X [@HoCPetitions](https://x.com/HoCPetitions) for updates, or check back on the petitions site for news.
