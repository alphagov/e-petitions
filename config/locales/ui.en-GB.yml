        <h1 class="page-title" id="creating-a-petition">Creating a petition</h1>

        <p>Petitioning is one of the most direct ways to suggest how something could change. Petitions can:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>Raise awareness of an issue;</li>
          <li>Bring about a change in Welsh Government policy or a different way of delivering services;</li>
          <li>Propose or influence a new law;</li>
          <li>Prompt a Senedd Committee to hold an inquiry;</li>
          <li>Lead to, or influence, a debate in the Senedd;</li>
          <li>Prompt a Committee or individual Members of the Senedd to take further action themselves, for instance by asking questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can submit a petition using our online petitions system, on paper, or a combination of the two.</p>

        <p><u>Petitions from other websites are not accepted by the Petitions Committee.</u></p>

        <p>If you are considering collecting signatures on paper, you should <a href="mailto:petitions@senedd.wales">contact us</a> in advance for advice. A template can also be provided.</p>

        <h1 class="page-title" id="how-petitions-work">How petitions work</h1>

        <ol class="list-number">
          <li>You create a petition. Only people or organisations with an address in Wales can create a petition.</li>
          <li>You get %{moderation_threshold} people to support your petition. We’ll tell you how to do this when you’ve created your petition.</li>
          <li>We check your petition, then publish it in Welsh and English. We only reject petitions that don’t meet the standards for petitions (see below).</li>
          <li>People can only sign a petition once. If they sign the petition online, they will be sent an email to verify their signature. People cannot sign both an online and a paper petition.</li>
          <li>The Petitions Committee reviews all petitions that collect over %{referral_threshold} signatures. They will decide what they can do to help take the petition forward. This can include exploring the issue and pressing for action from the Welsh Government and others.</li>
          <li>If your petition gets over %{debate_threshold} signatures, the Petitions Committee will consider asking for a debate in the Senedd chamber. The Committee will consider a number of factors, including the issues raised by the petition, the urgency of the situation and the proportion of signatures which come from within Wales.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="the-petitions-committee">The Petitions Committee</h2>

        <p>As part of their consideration of your petition, the <a href="https://senedd.wales/committees/petitions-committee/">Petitions Committee</a> can:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>write to you for more information;</li>
          <li>invite you to talk to the Committee in person about the petition;</li>
          <li>ask for evidence from the Welsh Government or other relevant people or organisations;</li>
          <li>press the Welsh Government for action;</li>
          <li>raise the petition with another Senedd committee;</li>
          <li>put forward the petition for debate;</li>
          <li>run a detailed inquiry and publish a report on the topic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="standards">Standards for petitions</h2>

        <p>You can submit a petition on any issue that is the responsibility of the Senedd or the Welsh Government.</p>

        <p>Petitions must call for a specific action from the Senedd or Welsh Government.</p>

        <p>Petitions can disagree with the Welsh Government and can ask for it to change its policies. Petitions can be critical of the Senedd or Welsh Government.</p>

        <p>We reject petitions that don’t meet the rules. If we reject your petition, we will tell you why. If we can, we will suggest other ways you could raise your issue.</p>

        <p>We’ll have to reject your petition if:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>It calls for the same action as a petition that’s already open, or one which was closed by the Petitions Committee less than a year earlier;</li>
          <li>It doesn’t ask for a clear action from the Senedd or Welsh Government;</li>
          <li>
            <p>It’s about something the Welsh Government or Parliament is not responsible for;</p>
            <p>That includes: something that your local council is responsible for (including planning decisions); something that the UK Government or Parliament is responsible for; and something that an independent organisation has done.</p>
          </li>
          <li>It contains language which is offensive, intemperate, or provocative. This not only includes obvious profanities, swear words and insults, but any language which a reasonable person would regard as offensive;</li>
          <li>It contains potentially false or potentially defamatory statements;</li>
          <li>It refers to a case that’s active in the UK courts;</li>
          <li>It contains material that is prohibited from being published by an order of a court or a body or person with similar power;</li>
          <li>It accuses an identifiable person or organisation of a crime;</li>
          <li>It contains material that could be confidential or commercially sensitive;</li>
          <li>It could cause personal distress or loss;</li>
          <li>It names individual officials of public bodies, unless they are senior managers;</li>
          <li>It names family members of elected representatives or officials of public bodies;</li>
          <li>It’s an advert, spam, or promotes a specific product or service;</li>
          <li>It’s nonsense or a joke;</li>
          <li>
            <p>It concerns an issue for which a petition is not the appropriate channel.</p>
            <p>That includes: correspondence about a personal issue and petitions which ask for someone to be given a job, lose their job or resign, or which call for a vote of no confidence.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We publish the text of petitions that we reject, as long as they’re not:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>defamatory, libellous or illegal in another way;</li>
          <li>about a case that is active in the UK courts or about something that a court has issued an injunction over;</li>
          <li>offensive or extreme;</li>
          <li>confidential or likely to cause personal distress; or</li>
          <li>a joke, an advert or nonsense.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can find the full rules governing the petitions process <a href="/rules">here</a>.</p>

          <p>In addition, for people who start a petition we will also collect:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>your postal address</li>
            <li>your contact telephone number</li>
            <li>any personal information or details that you provide within the petition itself.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We sometimes receive information relating to people who have signed petitions on paper. Paper petitions are securely stored and retained for the same period as personal data received through our own electronic petitions system. They are destroyed in a secure manner at the end of the retention period.</p>

          <h3>Why we need your data</h3>

          <p>We use this information to:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>facilitate the petitions process</li>
            <li>make sure that people only sign a petition once</li>
            <li>check that you’re eligible to start a petition</li>
            <li>contact you about petitions you start</li>
            <li>if you choose to sign up to email updates about what happens in the Senedd on petitions you’ve signed</li>
            <li>we may occasionally contact people who start or submit petitions to seek feedback on the petitions process and how it could be improved.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What we do with your data</h3>

          <p>We use your personal information to process the petition you have started or signed.</p>

          <p>If you start a petition and we accept it, your name will be published alongside any text you include within the petition. We won’t publish any of your contact details. If you start a petition, your name will remain permanently referenced alongside the petition on the Petitions Committee’s web pages and in meeting transcripts and recordings, as part of the official record of the Senedd’s petitions process.</p>

          <p>If you’ve signed a petition, we won’t publish any personal information about you.</p>

          <p>We’ll use your postcode to work out how many people in Wales and within each Senedd constituency and region have signed a petition.</p>

          <p>We will retain your personal data from the date you start or sign a petition until 12 months after it is no longer being considered by the Petitions Committee, i.e. until 12 months after the Committee considers the petition to be completed, apart from any personal data which has been published.</p>

          <p>Any information which has been published will remain permanently online in the records of the Senedd’s petitions process, including in any material published by the Petitions Committee.</p>

          <p>IP addresses are used to protect the petitions site and prevent fraudulent activity.</p>

          <p>We will share your data if we’re required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

          <h3>What we’ll email you about</h3>

          <p>If a petition you’ve started is referred to the Petitions Committee, we’ll use your contact details to update you about the petition’s progress and to offer you the opportunity to provide further information and engage with the Committee.</p>

          <p>You will receive automated confirmation emails when you set up or sign a petition.</p>

          <p>If you’ve signed a petition, you can choose to receive updates about the progress of the petition. This might include contacting you to let you know what is happening in the Senedd in relation to your petition, such as: debates that you can watch or read, chances to respond to a consultation, or ways to let committees and Members of the Senedd know why the petition is important to you.</p>

          <p>We may occasionally use your contact details to seek your views on the Senedd’s petitions process.</p>

          <p>You can stop these emails at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email.</p>

          <h3>Who has access to the data and where is it processed and stored</h3>

          <p>Senedd Commission staff administering the petitions process will have access to your personal information.</p>

          <p>Unboxed Consulting Limited who provide technical support for the petitions system will also have access to the system for troubleshooting and maintenance purposes only.</p>

          <p>Electronic information will be stored on Senedd ICT systems, which includes third party cloud services provided by Microsoft. Any transfer of data by Microsoft outside of the EEA is covered by contractual clauses under which Microsoft ensure that personal data is treated in line with European legislation.</p>

          <p>The petitions system uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage to store your data. AWS store data within the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

          <p>The petitions system uses the GOV.UK Notify service to send emails relating to the petitions process including updates. Emails sent are stored for 7 days. The privacy notice for the GOV.UK Notify service is available here: <a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/privacy">www.notifications.service.gov.uk/privacy</a>.

          <h3>How we protect your data and keep it secure</h3>

          <p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. All third parties who process personal data for us are required to keep that data secure.</p>

          <h3>Our legal bases for collecting, holding and using your personal information</h3>

          <p>Data protection law sets out various legal bases (or ‘conditions’) which allow us to collect, hold and use your personal information.</p>

          <p>We consider that our collection and use of your information is necessary to help us facilitate the petitions process and allow the public the chance to raise and show support for issues with the Senedd.</p>

          <p>As such, personal data is processed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest in accordance with Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), read together with section 8(d) of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

          <p>Where we are required to process personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation, such as a request under access to information legislation or a court order, we will do so on the basis that processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR.</p>

          <p>We may process personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences. In order to comply with Article 10 of the GDPR, this data will be processed in accordance with our Article 6 legal basis, as outlined above, and section 10 of, and paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to, the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

          <p>Finally, we may process special categories of personal data of those who start or sign a petition, and/or contribute to its passage through the Senedd’s petitions process. Special category personal data is defined in Article 9(1) of the GDPR as the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade-union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>

          <p>Special category personal data will usually be processed on the basis that it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, pursuant to Article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR read in conjunction with section 10 of, and paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to, the Data Protection Act 2018. However, where your special category personal data is made public by you, it may be processed on the basis that it has already been manifestly made public by you, pursuant to Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR.</p>

          <h3>Requests for information made to the Commission</h3>

          <p>The Senedd is subject to access to information legislation. In the event of a request for information being made under access to information legislation, it may be necessary to disclose all or part of the information that you provide. However, we will only do this if we are required to do so by law.</p>

          <h3>What are your rights</h3>

          <p>You have certain rights over the information we hold. In summary, the rights include:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>The right to be informed about how your personal information is used;</li>
            <li>The right of access to copies of your personal information;</li>
            <li>The right to rectification if your information is inaccurate;</li>
            <li>The right to restrict our use of your personal information in certain circumstances;</li>
            <li>The right to object to the use of your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you would like to engage any of these rights, please email information-request@senedd.wales</p>

          <h3>Changes to this notice</h3>

          <p>We may change this privacy notice. In that case the ‘last updated’ date at the top of this page will also change. Any changes to this privacy notice will apply to you and your data immediately. If these changes affect how your personal data is processed, we will take reasonable steps to make sure you know.</p>

        <h1 class="page-title">Determination by the Presiding Officer under Standing Order 23.3 of the Proper Form of Petitions</h1>

        <p>The Presiding Officer has made the following determination of the proper form of public petitions submitted under Standing Order 23.</p>

        <ol class="list-number">
          <li>
            <h2>Means and format for submission</h2>
            <p>Petitions may be submitted on paper or electronically using the Senedd’s online petitions system. Petitions may collect signatures for a maximum period of six months.</p>
            <p>For a paper petition the petition wording should be set out in full on each sheet (or side of a sheet) where signatures are asked for. A template is available on request.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Wording</h2>
            <p>Petitions should be submitted in good faith. They should call for the Senedd or the Welsh Government to take some specific action.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Basic Requirements</h2>
            <p>Petitions must clearly indicate:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>the name of the petitioner, who may be an individual or an organisation;</li>
              <li>the petitioner’s address, which must be in Wales, to which all communications concerning the petition should be sent;</li>
              <li>signatures from at least 50 people who support the petition and their names and addresses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Petitions must not:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>contain language which is offensive, intemperate, or provocative. This not only includes obvious profanities swear words and insults, but any language which a reasonable person would regard as offensive;</li>
              <li>ask the Senedd to do anything which it clearly has no power to do (in particular petitions about matters that are not devolved are not admissible);</li>
              <li>be the same as, or substantially similar to, a petition that is currently open or was closed less than a year earlier.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Petitions must comply in other ways with this determination.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Other factors concerning admissibility</h2>
            <p>Petitions that include or ask the Senedd to consider the following are not admissible:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>to intervene in the operational decisions or actions of local authorities and National Park Authorities, including planning decisions;</li>
              <li>for an individual to be appointed to or removed from a role or position, to resign, or for a vote of no confidence;</li>
              <li>to adjudicate, arbitrate or mediate personal or commercial interests (this is the role of a court or tribunal);</li>
              <li>matters that are ‘sub judice’ (subject to legal proceedings in the courts);</li>
              <li>matters that are already subject to determination by an ombudsman (or person with similar powers).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Petitions must not contain:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>potentially false or potentially defamatory statements;</li>
              <li>information which is prohibited from being published by an order of a court or a body or person with similar power;</li>
              <li>material which is potentially confidential, commercially sensitive, or which may cause personal distress or loss;</li>
              <li>any commercial endorsement, promotion of any product, service or publication or statements that amount to advertisements;</li>
              <li>the names of officials of public bodies, unless they are part of the senior management of those organisations;</li>
              <li>the names of family members of elected representatives or officials of public bodies;</li>
              <li>the names of individuals, or information where they may be identified, in relation to criminal charges;</li>
              <li>issues for which a petition is not the appropriate channel (for example, correspondence about a personal issue).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Freedom of Information (FOI) requests</h2>
            <p>Petitions that are essentially FOI requests will not be allowed. There are other specific arrangements for FOI requests.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h2>Public Services Ombudsman for Wales (PSOW) cases</h2>
            <p>Petitions alleging specific cases of maladministration or service failure by public bodies are not admissible. In these cases petitioners are advised to contact the PSOW to take forward their concerns.</p>
