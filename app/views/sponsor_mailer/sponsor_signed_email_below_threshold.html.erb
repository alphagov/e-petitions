<p>Hi <%= @petition.creator_signature.name %>,</p>

<p>One of the sponsors you nominated for your petition "<%= @petition.title %>", <%= @sponsor.signature.name %>, has signed it to show their support.</p>

<p>You have support from <%= @supporting_sponsors_count %> of your nominated sponsors; you still need <%= @moderation_threshold - @supporting_sponsors_count %> more before you have enough support to pass the petition to parliament for moderation review.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
