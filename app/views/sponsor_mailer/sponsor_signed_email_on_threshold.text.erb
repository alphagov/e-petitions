Dear <%= @creator.name %>,

Someone supported your petition: “[<%= @petition.action %>][1]”.

<%= pluralize(@sponsor_count, "person", locale: :en) %> have supported your petition.

We’re checking it to make sure it meets the [petition standards][2].

If it does, we’ll publish it. If it doesn’t, we’ll let you know why.

This can take up to 10 working days. During holiday periods, this may take longer. Thank you for your patience.

Once your petition has <%= Site.maximum_number_of_sponsors %> supporters, no one else will be able to sign it until it’s been checked. Please wait until it’s been checked and published before sharing more widely.
