Dear <%= @petition.creator.name %>,

Someone supported your petition: “[<%= @petition.action %>][1]”.

<%= pluralize(@sponsor_count, "person", locale: :en) %> have supported your petition. We’re checking it to make sure it meets the [petition standards][2]. If it does, we’ll publish it. If it doesn’t, we’ll let you know why.

We currently have a very large number of petitions to check, so it may take longer than 10 working days to check your petition. Thank you for your patience.
