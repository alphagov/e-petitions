Dear <%= @petition.creator.name %>,

Someone supported your petition: “<%= @petition.action %>”.
<%= petition_url(@petition) %>

You have <%= pluralize(@sponsor_count, "supporter", locale: :en) %> so far.

If <%= number_to_word(Site.threshold_for_moderation) %> people support your petition, we’ll check it to make sure it meets the petition standards:
<%= help_url(anchor: 'standards') %>

If it does, we’ll publish it. If it doesn’t, we’ll let you know why.

<%= render "footer" %>
