Dear <%= @creator.name %>,

Someone supported your petition: “[<%= @petition.action %>][1]”.

<%= pluralize(@sponsor_count, "person", locale: :en) %> have supported your petition. We’re checking it to make sure it meets the [petition standards][2]. If it does, we’ll publish it. If it doesn’t, we’ll let you know why.

We currently have a very large number of petitions to check, so it may take a number of weeks to check your petition. Thank you for your patience.

Once your petition has <%= Site.maximum_number_of_sponsors %> supporters, no one else will be able to sign it until it’s been checked. Please wait until it’s been checked and published before sharing more widely.
