Dear <%= @creator.name %>,

Forward the email below to your potential supporters.

<% if christmas_period? %>
Once you’ve gained the required number of supporters, we’ll check your petition to make sure it meets the petition standards. If it does we’ll publish it. This usually takes a week or less but over the Christmas period it will take us a little longer than usual. We’ll check your petition as quickly as we can.

<% elsif moderation_delay? %>
Once you’ve gained the required number of supporters, we’ll check your petition to make sure it meets the petition standards. If it does, we’ll publish it. This usually takes a week or less, however we have a very large number to check at the moment so it is likely to take longer. Thank you for your patience.

Once your petition has <%= Site.maximum_number_of_signatures %> signatures it won’t be able to add more until it’s been checked by the petitions team. So, please wait until it’s been checked and published before sharing it more widely.

Thanks,
