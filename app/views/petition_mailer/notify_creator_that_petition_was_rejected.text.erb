Dear <%= @signature.name %>,

Sorry, we can’t accept your petition – “<%= @petition.action %>”.
<% unless @petition.hidden? -%>
<%= petition_url(@petition) %>
<% end -%>

<%= strip_tags(rejection_description(@rejection.code)) %>
<% if @rejection.details? %>

<%= @rejection.details %>
<% end %>
We can only accept petitions that meet the petition standards.

If you like, you can start a new petition:
<%= check_petitions_url %>

We understand that it can be disappointing when your petition cannot be accepted.
There are also other ways to raise issues in Parliament:
