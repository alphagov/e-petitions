Hi <%= @signature.name %>,

Unfortunately we’re closing all petitions on 31 March 2015, including your petition "<%= @signature.petition.action %>":
<%= petition_url(@signature.petition) %>

Parliament will be dissolved on 30 March 2015 and it’s not possible for petitions to remain open once Parliament has been dissolved.

Sorry you won't have as long to collect signatures as you expected.

If you want to give feedback, please contact us:
<%= contact_url %>

Thanks,
<%= t("petitions.emails.signoff_prefix") %>
<%= t("petitions.emails.signoff_suffix") %>
