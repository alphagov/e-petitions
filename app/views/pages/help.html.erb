<h1 class="page-title">How petitions work</h1>

<ol class="list-number">
  <li>You create a petition. Only British citizens and UK residents can create or sign a petition.</li>
  <li>You get 5 people to support your petition. We’ll tell you how to do this when you’ve created your petition.</li>
  <li>We check your petition, then publish it. We only reject petitions that don’t meet the standards for petitions.</li>
  <li>At 10,000 signatures you get a response from the government.</li>
  <li>At 100,000 signatures your petition will be considered for a debate in Parliament.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Debates</h2>

<p>Petitions which reach 100,000 signatures are almost always debated. But we may decide not to put a petition forward for debate because it doesn’t fit with parliamentary business (for example, because the issue has already been debated recently &ndash; or there’s a debate scheduled for the near future). If that’s the case, we’ll tell you how you can find out more about parliamentary debates on the issue raised by your petition.</p>

<p>If it’s something that Parliament should discuss, MPs might consider your petition for a debate before it reaches 100,000 signatures.</p>

<p>We may contact you about the issue covered by your petition. For example, we sometimes invite people who create petitions to take part in a discussion with MPs or government ministers, or to give evidence to a select committee. We may also write to other people or organisations to ask them about the issue raised by your petition.</p>

<h2 id="standards">Standards for petitions</h2>

<p>We’ll only reject your petition if it’s:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>about something that the UK government or Parliament is not responsible for</li>
  <li>about something that’s the responsibility of a devolved body (eg the Scottish Parliament)</li>
  <li>about a purely personal issue</li>
  <li>abusive, obscene or contains hate speech</li>
  <li>deceptive or misleading</li>
  <li>advertising or spam</li>
  <li>nonsensical, or a joke</li>
  <li>party political</li>
  <li>about honours or appointments &ndash; there’s a different way to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/honours">nominate someone for an honour</a></li>
  <li>breaks the law or violates intellectual property rights</li>
  <li>covered by a court order, injunction or is about a court case that can’t be discussed publicly</li>
  <li>potentially confidential, commercially sensitive or might cause someone distress or financial loss</li>
  <li>names people working in public bodies (except for senior management)</li>
  <li>names family members of elected officials or people working in public bodies</li>
</ul>

<p>We usually check petitions within seven days. If we reject your petition, we’ll tell you why. If we can, we’ll suggest other ways you could raise your issue.</p>

<p>We publish the text of petitions that we reject, as long as they’re not illegal, offensive or confidential.</p>

<h2 id="petitions-committee">The Petitions Committee</h2>

<p>The Petitions Committee is appointed by the House of Commons. It comprises up to 11 backbench Members of Parliament from Government and Opposition parties, and is calculated to reflect the membership of the House as a whole.</p>

<p>The Petitions Committee can:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>correspond with petitioners on their petition</li>
  <li>call petitioners for oral evidence</li>
  <li>refer a petition to the relevant select committee</li>
  <li>ask for further information from the Government, orally or in writing, on the subject of a petition</li>
  <li>put forward petitions for debate.</li>
</ul>
