@admin
Feature: Admin hub page
  In order to help administrators see the next actions they need to take
  As any moderator user
  I want to view a page which lists totals for actionable list and links to them

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a moderator

  Scenario: I can see a total of petitions needing moderation and link to them
    Given 20 petitions exist with state: "sponsored"
    And there are 12 petitions awaiting a government response
    And there are 5 petitions with a scheduled debate date
    And there are 3 petitions with enough signatures to require a debate
    When I go to the Admin home page
    Then I should see "20 Moderation queue"
    And I should see "12 Government response queue"
    And I should see "8 Debate queue"
    And I should see "All Petitions (40)"
    And I should be connected to the server via an ssl connection
    And the markup should be valid

  Scenario: I can see when there are petitions that are overdue moderation
    Given 5 overdue moderation petitions exist
    When I go to the Admin home page
    Then the overdue moderation panel should have the queue danger style applied
    And the moderation summary should have the queue danger style applied
    And the overdue moderation panel should show 5

  Scenario: I can see when there are petitions that are nearly overdue moderation
    Given 5 nearly overdue moderation petitions exist
    When I go to the Admin home page
    Then the nearly overdue moderation panel should have the queue caution style applied
    And the moderation summary should have the queue caution style applied
    And the nearly overdue moderation panel should show 5

  Scenario: I can see when there are petitions that have recently joined the moderation queue
    Given 5 recently in moderation petitions exist
    When I go to the Admin home page
    Then the nearly overdue moderation panel should have the queue stable style applied
    And the overdue moderation panel should have the queue stable style applied
    And the moderation summary should have the queue stable style applied
    And the recently in moderation panel should show 5

  Scenario: I can see when there are petitions in moderation that are tagged
    Given allowed tags in site settings are "tag 1"
    And a sponsored petition "Raise benefits" exists with tags "tag 1"
    When I go to the Admin home page
    And the tagged panel should show 1

  Scenario: I can click through to see lists of matching petitions
    Given 12 petitions exist with state: "sponsored"
    When I go to the Admin home page
    And I follow "12 Moderation queue"
    Then I should be on the Admin all petitions page
