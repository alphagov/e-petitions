Feature: A moderator user views all petitions
  In order to see a full list of all the petitions
  As any moderator user
  I want to view a paginated list of Open, Rejected and Closed petitions, sorted by signature count (descending), then most recent. I want to be able to filter this list by state and follow links to change petition details.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a moderator

  Scenario: Viewing all petitions
    Given a set of petitions
    When I view all petitions
    And the markup should be valid

  Scenario: Follow links to change details
    Given a petition "My petition"
    When I view all petitions
    And I view the petition
    Then I should see the petition details

  Scenario: Filter list by state
