Feature: Maggie searches for petitions by keyword
  In order to find petitions containing a certain keyword
  As Maggie
  I would like to be able to enter a keyword, and see all petitions that have the word in their action, background or supporting details

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a moderator

  Scenario: When searching for keyword, it returns all petitions with keyword in action OR background OR additional_details
    Given a petition "p1" exists with action: "Raise benefits", state: "open", open_at: "1 day ago", closed_at: "1 day from now"
    And a petition "p2" exists with action: "Help the poor", background: "Need higher benefits", state: "open", open_at: "1 day ago", closed_at: "1 day from now"
    And a petition "p3" exists with action: "Help the homeless", additional_details: "Could raise benefits", state: "open", open_at: "1 day ago", closed_at: "1 day from now"
    And a petition "p4" exists with action: "Petition about something else", state: "open", open_at: "1 day ago", closed_at: "1 day from now"
    When I search for petitions with keyword "benefits"
    Then I should see the following list of petitions:
          | Raise benefits    |
          | Help the poor     |
          | Help the homeless |

  Scenario: When searching for keyword, it returns all petitions no matter what petition state
    Given an open petition exists with action: "My open petition about benefits"
    And a closed petition exists with action: "My closed petition about benefits"
    And a rejected petition exists with action: "My rejected petition about benefits"
    And a hidden petition exists with action: "My hidden petition about benefits"
    And an open petition exists with action: "My open petition about something else"
    When I search for petitions with keyword "benefits"
    Then I should see the following list of petitions:
          | My open petition about benefits     |
          | My closed petition about benefits   |
          | My rejected petition about benefits |
          | My hidden petition about benefits   |

  Scenario: A user can search by keyword from the admin hub
    Given a petition "p1" exists with action: "Raise benefits", state: "open", open_at: "1 day ago", closed_at: "1 day from now"
    And a petition "p2" exists with action: "Help the poor", background: "Need higher benefits", state: "open", open_at: "1 day ago", closed_at: "1 day from now"
